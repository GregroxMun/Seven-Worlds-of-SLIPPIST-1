		Body
		{
			name = SLIPPIST-1/SLIPPIST-1
			Values
			{
				InSpaceLow = You're not sure if the suit can handle this much heat and light.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = SLIPPIST-1/Bravo
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = Oh no.
				SrfLanded = You have to get back in the ship NOW.
				FlyingHigh = You're not sure this is a good idea.
				FlyingLow = You're sure this is not a good idea.
				InSpace = Looking down, you see no evidence of a solid surface. The deep atmosphere is totally filled with a blue-green haze.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = SLIPPIST-1/Charlie
			Values
			{
				FlyingHigh = It would probably be best to get back into the ship, if at all possible.
				FlyingLow = It's getting awfully toasty...
				SrfLanded = This world is really very desolate. But at least it has a solid surface.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = SLIPPIST-1/Delta
			Values
			{
				SrfLandedIceCaps = The ice is a little crispy here. You ought to take care.
				SrfLandedThinIce = The ice is very thin and seems to crack with every step.
				SrfLandedThinFarsideIce = You have trouble seeing where you're going in the dark far side ice, which is a little disconcerting when the ice seems to crack with every step.
				SrfLandedFarsideIceCaps = You're having trouble seeing where you're going in the dark. You look up to the sky and search for Echo, or failing that, some other bright planetary nightlight.
				SrfSplashedOcean = The water is at least temperate. Good thing they taught you how to swim.
				SrfSplashedFarsideOcean = You can't tell where you are or where you're going, so you just tread water in your buoyant space suit.
			}

		Body
		{
			name = SLIPPIST-1/Echo
			Values
			{
				InSpaceLow = Looking down you see shades of blue, orange, red, and green, all painted on to a massive globe beneath you.

		}
		Body
		{
			name = SLIPPIST-1/Foxtrot
			Values
			{
				InSpace = WTF, get back in the ship.
				SrfSplashed = As the water chills you down, you turn on your space suit's heater.
				SrfLandedThinIce = The land here is a little thin and crispy, you take extra care not to crack the ice.
				SrfLandedIce = The situation is nominal. Ice isn't giving way either.
				SrfLandedSnow = You wonder if snow-angels are possible on Foxtrot.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = SLIPPIST-1/Golf
			Values
			{

			name = SLIPPIST-1/Hotel
			Values
