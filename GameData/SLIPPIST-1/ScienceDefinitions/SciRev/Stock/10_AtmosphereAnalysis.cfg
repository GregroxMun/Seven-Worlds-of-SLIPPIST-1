			name = SLIPPIST-1/SLIPPIST-1
			Values
			{
				Flying = Surely there's a piece of equipment better suited to this kind of work? Because this one is falling apart.

		Body
		{
			name = SLIPPIST-1/Bravo
			Values

		Body
		{
			name = SLIPPIST-1/Charlie
			Values
			{
				Flying = Charlie's atmosphere is mostly made out of CO2. Which, as a greenhouse gas, explains all the heat.
