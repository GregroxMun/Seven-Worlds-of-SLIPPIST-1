			Values
			{
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = SLIPPIST-1/Bravo
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = The sample is too hot to store in an ordinary storage container. You try again with an insulated container.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = SLIPPIST-1/Charlie
			Values
			{
				SrfLandedVolcanoes = You pick up a sample of volcanic glass. Perhaps if you had enough, say, 10 cubic meters of the stuff, you could open a portal to hell. Though, you suppose, you're not far off here.
				SrfLandedSubstellarPlains = Some of the rock samples are almost like a rubbery dough, filled with harder little pebbles.
				SrfLanded = The surface here is mostly metamorphic rocks.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = SLIPPIST-1/Delta
			Values
			{
				SrfSplashed = The sample is a mineral-rich water with several organic compounds. These should be investigated with a microscope!
				SrfLanded = The sample is solid ice, with some mineral impurities, covered in a layer of snow.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = SLIPPIST-1/Echo
			Values
			{
				SrfSplashed = The sample dramatically increases the humidity of anything it touches. Fascinating
				SrfSplashedWaterTongue = The water here is remarkably clear, though it's hard to tell in this lighting.
				SrfSplashedPolarLakes = There's a significant amount of silt in the water sample.
				SrfLandedMountainTops = The sample is a hard metamorphic rock.
				SrfLandedHighlands = The dirt sample is somewhat moist and contains a not-insignificant amount of organic matter--and actual bits of grass and moss!
				SrfLandedLowlands = The dirt sample is somewhat moist and contains a not-insignificant amount of organic matter--and actual bits of grass.
				SrfLandedDeserts = The sand here is a fine, almost powdery material that flows smoothly.
				SrfLandedSandPlains = The sand here is coarse and rough, and very dry indeed.
				SrfLandedTundra = The sample contains an awful lot of ice, and is very tough.
				SrfLandedIceCap = The surface here is covered in a thick layer of snow, and underneath is a hard ice.
				SrfLandedIceCapHighlands = The surface here is covered in a thin dusting of snow, and underneath is a hard, ancient ice.

		{
			name = SLIPPIST-1/Foxtrot
			Values
			{
				SrfSplashed = The sample is a mineral-rich water with several organic compounds. These should be investigated with a microscope!

		Body
		{
			name = SLIPPIST-1/Golf
			Values
			{
				SrfSplashed = The sample is a mineral-rich water with several organic compounds. These should be investigated with a microscope!
				SrfLanded = The sample is solid ice, with some mineral impurities, covered in a layer of snow.

		Body
		{
			name = SLIPPIST-1/Hotel
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = The ice is very solid here. You struggle to hammer off a chunk.
