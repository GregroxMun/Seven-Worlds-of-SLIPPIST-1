@PART[GooExperiment]:FOR[aSLIPPIST-1]:NEEDS[!InterstellarConsortium]
{
	@description = This unit is something our field biologists discovered in the swampy lakes during a Slippist Flare. It was labeled an "unknown sample" until back in the lab, after the flare, the sample tried to escape from its jar. It was promptly confined in a more rigid container, and has been used in a variety of important scientific experiments.

	@RESULTS
	{
		Body
		{
			name = SLIPPIST-1/SLIPPIST-1
			Values
			{
				InSpaceLowStarspots = The goo expands its volume to fill the container, emitting loud shrieking sounds which are loud enough to be heard throughout the spacecraft.
				SlippistInSpaceHigh = The goo forms an orange sphere with large arcs of tentacles, mimicking the structure of the Sun. It then shatters into tiny pieces which form seven tiny spheres.
				SlippistInSpaceHigh = The goo turns into an array of chaotically moving and rotating cylinders which occasionally link together.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = SLIPPIST-1/Bravo
			Values
			{
				InSpace = The goo roils and boils, bubbling into a mist that fills the container.
				SrfLanded = The goo solidifes into a red hot, rock-hard tetrahedron, surrounded in a mist.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = SLIPPIST-1/Charlie
			Values
			{
				InSpace = The goo begins to swirl into a spiral pattern.
				SrfLanded = The... where is the goo? It's not there!
				SrfLanded = The goo disappears, and several minutes later it reappears in the shape of a silent, screaming red face.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = SLIPPIST-1/Delta
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = The goo stretches out into a tentacle which wraps around a spherical mass.
				SrfSplashed = The goo escapes into the water and dissolves.
				InSpace = The goo turns into a rotating torus.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = SLIPPIST-1/Echo
			Values
			{
				SrfLandedSandPlains = The goo shape-shifts into the shape of a face which begins to cry before melting into an orange puddle.
				InSpace = The goo begins bouncing around the container at progressively higher speeds, damaging the instruments.
				SrfLanded = The goo attempts to escape from the capsule, but the automatic Sample Confinement System in the container zaps it enough to keep it inside.
				SrfLanded = The goo shape-shifts into a frowning face that begins to make unintelligible babbling sounds.
				SrfLandedKSC = The goo forms the appearance of two blocks which make up the approximate proportions of the VAB. It then shakes, and partially melts from the top down, emitting a reddish mist and a loud shriek. This behavior is noted as being similar to what occurred in the Research and Development laboratory after some very intruiging physical experiments were done to the sample.
				SrfLandedMountainTops = The goo congeals into a putty-like substance which makes a noise that sounds vaguelly like "End."
				SrfSplashed = The goo seeps out of the canister and into the water, where it grows in size several times before sinking.
				SrfSplashedPolarLakes = The goo pours out of the canister, begins to freeze, and tries to swim back to the canister, but it freezes solid and sinks before it can surface.
				SrfSplashedWaterTongue = The goo pours out of the canister, begins to freeze, and tries to swim back to the canister, but it freezes solid and sinks before it can surface.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = SLIPPIST-1/Foxtrot
			Values
			{
				InSpace = The mystery goo has become brittle and seems to act as if there is a downward gravitational force, even when not under thrust.
				SrfSplashed = The mystery goo escapes the canister and turns into a cluster of small green spheres which sink down into the ocean.
				SrfLanded = The goo takes the shape of three coin-sized disks which bounce around the container.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = SLIPPIST-1/Golf
			Values
			{
				InSpace = The goo forms a large eyeball-shaped sphere with a tiny droplet orbiting around it.
				InSpace = The goo freezes solid all except a small spiralling circle on one side.
				SrfSplashed = The goo escapes into the water for a few moments before returning a bright glowing pink color.
				SrfLanded = The goo remains a puddle on the bottom of the container. It may have frozen solid.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = SLIPPIST-1/Hotel
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = The goo grows solid, brittle spikes which break off, revealing more spikes which take their place. The spikes that fall off turn into simple stick figures that run around the main mass, all apparently fighting and eating each other.
				SrfLanded = The Myster Goo turns into a solid brick.
