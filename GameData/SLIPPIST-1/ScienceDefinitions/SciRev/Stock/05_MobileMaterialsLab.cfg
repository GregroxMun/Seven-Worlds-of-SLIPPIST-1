		Body
		{
			name = SLIPPIST-1/SLIPPIST-1
			Values
			{
				InSpaceHigh = Some of the samples begin to glow in tandem with stellar flares! It might be fun to paint the spacecraft with this.
				InSpaceLow = Many of the samples are beginning to melt and sublimate.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = SLIPPIST-1/Bravo
			Values
			{
				InSpaceHigh = Some of the samples with lower boiling points are beginning to fizzle away.
				FlyingHigh = Some of the alkaline metal samples are fizzling.
				FlyingLow = The alkaline metal samples EXPLODE, damaging many of the other samples. Perhaps it was not the best idea to put them here.
				SrfLanded = Many of the samples are beginning to melt and sublimate.
			}

		Body
		{
			name = SLIPPIST-1/Charlie
			Values
			{
				FlyingHigh = Some of the samples with lower boiling points are beginning to fizzle away.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = SLIPPIST-1/Delta
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = Some of the samples with low melting points are freezing. Fascinating. Some of the samples begin to corrode.
				SrfSplashed = The alkaline metal samples EXPLODE, damaging many of the other samples. Perhaps it was not the best idea to put them here.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = SLIPPIST-1/Echo
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = Ah, good idea, best to take some control measurements on the ground.
				InSpace = You run some basic chemistry experiments, taking note of how the samples react to the zero gravity environment.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = SLIPPIST-1/Foxtrot
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = Some of the samples with low melting points are freezing. Fascinating. Some of the samples begin to corrode.
				SrfSplashed = The alkaline metal samples EXPLODE, damaging many of the other samples. Perhaps it was not the best idea to put them here.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = SLIPPIST-1/Golf
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = Some of the samples with low melting points are freezing. Fascinating. Some of the samples begin to corrode.
				SrfSplashed = The alkaline metal samples EXPLODE, damaging many of the other samples. Perhaps it was not the best idea to put them here.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = SLIPPIST-1/Hotel
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = Some of the samples with low melting points are freezing. Other samples are boiling entirely in the low pressure. Other samples still are glowing from the high-radiation environment.
