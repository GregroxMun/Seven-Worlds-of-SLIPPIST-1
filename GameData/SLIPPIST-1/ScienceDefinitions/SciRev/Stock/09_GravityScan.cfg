	@RESULTS
	{
		Body
		{
			name = SLIPPIST-1/SLIPPIST-1
			Values
			{
				InSpace = Measured precise gravitational field changes over time due to the motion of the planets.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = SLIPPIST-1/Bravo
			Values
			{
				InSpaceLow = There's some minor perturbations in the gravity field here. Perhaps there's some internal structure to Bravo's atmosphere, or perhaps there's some bumpy solid surface beneath the clouds.
				InSpaceHigh = Gravitational measurements indicate that Bravo is even less dense than previously thought. A significant amount of its mass must be made up of hot puffy volatiles.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = SLIPPIST-1/Charlie
			Values
			{
				InSpaceLow = There's some minor perturbations in the gravity field. We can use those perturbations to develop a very basic map of the surface.
				InSpaceHigh = Precisely measured the gravity, and therefore density, of Charlie. The planet is significantly denser than any planet other than Echo, and thus probably has a solid surface.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = SLIPPIST-1/Delta
			Values
			{
				InSpaceHigh = Precisely measured the gravity, and therefore density, of Delta. It seems to be too lightweight for any significant amount of rock.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = SLIPPIST-1/Echo
			Values
			{
				InSpaceHigh = Precisely measured the gravity, and therefore density, of Echo. It's the densest planet in the system, with a rocky surface and a significant iron core.
				InSpaceLow = Precisely mapped out the uneven gravity field shaped by Echo's continent and ice caps.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = SLIPPIST-1/Foxtrot
			Values
			{
				InSpace = Precisely measured the gravity, and therefore density, of Foxtrot. It's fucking low, okay?
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = SLIPPIST-1/Golf
			Values
			{
				InSpace = Precisely measured the gravity, and therefore density, of Golf. It's pretty low.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = SLIPPIST-1/Hotel
			Values
			{
				InSpace = Precisely measured the gravity, and therefore density, of Hotel. It's pretty low.
			}
