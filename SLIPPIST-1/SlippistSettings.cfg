	//"Home"
	//The default position, replacing the Stock System and becoming the home system. This is the only setting compatible with Principia's TRAPPIST-1 patch.
	//This setting is compatible with Interstellar Consortium if the IC plugin is installed. You will be able to select the homeworld with the tag home = SLIPPIST-1/SLIPPIST-1.
	//"Exoplanet"
	//Moves SLIPPIST-1 to 428 au away, compatible with Interstellar Consortium guidelines. Renames planets to systematic names, e.g. SLIPPIST-1e.
	//"Binary"
	//Moves Slippist to 3 au, making it a binary with The Sun. Renames Sun and Slippist to Kerbol A and Kerbol B. Renames planets to systematic names, e.g. Kerbol B e. (Not compatible with mods like OPM which add distant planets orbiting the Sun)
